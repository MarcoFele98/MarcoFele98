# Who?
Hey there! I am a PhD candidate in biological sciences at Swansea University, Wales (UK). I am investigating the effect of individual heterogeneity on collective behaviour, wih the aim of developing bio-inspired algorithms for swarm robotics. 

## Why ?

I often play with computational and analytical models by replicating scientific articles, mainly as a personal learning experience. I like to think "I can do this". I recently decided to share my efforts here, mainly to doucment my progress. Furthermore, I think the investment turns out better if my efforts also potentially help someone else, hence I have presented some of these projects also at our university journal club. DISCLAIMER: I am rendering public my code knowing that there will be bugs and general problems, even more so because I share things I am still learning about.

## What ?

My main passion is collective behvaiour, and within collective behvaiour, I am mostly interested in group decision-making. Most of the projects hence cover some of these topics. My second passion is evolutionary theory, and I try to squeeze some in whenever I can. Furthermore, I try to engage with methods that are new for me, and despite the main topics can be similar, I try to have variety in the specific concepts and techniques applied. 

Cheers!
