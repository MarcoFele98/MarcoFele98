# Hey there! 

## Who?
I am a PhD candidate in biological sciences at Swansea University, Wales (UK). I am investigating the effect of individual heterogeneity on collective behaviour, wih the aim of developing bio-inspired algorithms for swarm robotics. 

## Why ?

I often play with computational and analytical models by replicating scientific articles, mainly as a personal learning experience. I recently decided to share some of my efforts here, most importantly to document my progress. Furthermore, I have presented some of these projects also at our university journal club, because I think the time investment turns out better if my efforts can also help someone else. 

## What ?

My main passion is collective behaviour, and within collective behaviour, I am mostly interested in group decision-making. Most of the projects hence cover some of these topics. My second passion is evolutionary theory, and I try to squeeze some in whenever I can. Furthermore, I try to engage with models and methods that are new for me, and despite the main topics can be similar, I try to have variety in the specific concepts and techniques applied. 

Cheers! 

#### Disclaimer
I am rendering public my code knowing that there will probably be hidden bugs and general problems, even more so because I am sharing things I am still learning about by myself. Furthermore, despite I give some context and briefly overview the code, I do not give a complete explanation of the model (which can be found in the links I provide). I also try to annotate the code as best as I can, but I do not go in depth explaining how it works.
